# DESCRIPTION
This is the code for a note-taker application. In this application the user has to sign up using their name, email, password and age; then, they have to login using their email and password. In case the email and password is not correct then the user will receive the message "Failed to login". Once the user has login, he will be presented with a calendar and there he can add different notes and save them to look at them after. 
The user information is stored in the mySQL database, in our case, we use Laragon to administrate and check the data. Sensitive data such as passwords are stored as tokens. Also, Postman was used to check the functionality of the routes. 

# INSTALLATION INFORMATION
  To install all the node dependecies enter npm i, then enter npm run dev and go to port 4040 in your browser.

# USAGE INFORMATION
  Create an account with your name, email, password and age; fill in the login section and use the calendar to create, save and delete notes.
